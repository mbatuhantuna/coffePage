            <h2>Americano</h2>
            <img src="images/americano.png" alt="americano" id="coffee">
            <p>A single shot of espresso added to a cup of hot water.
                Many like to drink this as they would a
                regular brewed coffee with milk and sugar.
                Purists say to keep milk to a minimum to get the most flavor
                from the espresso</p>

        <article id="caffeLatteId">
            <h2>Caffe Latte</h2>
            <img src="images/caffeLatte.png" alt="caffeLatte" id="coffee2">
            <p>A cafe latte, or “latte” for short, is an espresso-based
                drink with steamed milk and micro-foam
                added to the coffee.
                This coffee is much sweeter compared to espresso
                due to the steamed milk.</p>

            <h2>Caffe Mocha</h2>
            <img src="images/caffeMocha.png" alt="caffeMocha" id="coffee3">
            <p>A mocha is a mix between a cappuccino and a hot chocolate.
                It is made by putting mixing
                chocolate powder with an espresso shot and then adding
                steamed milk and micro-foam into the beverage.</p>

            <h2>Cappuccino</h2>
            <img src="images/cappuccino.png" alt="cappuccino" id="coffee4">
            <p>A cappuccino is like a latte. However, the key difference
                between a latte and cappuccino is that a
                cappuccino has more foam and chocolate placed on top of
                the drink. Further, a cappuccino is made in a cup
                rather than a tumbler glass.</p>

                water through finely-ground coffee
                beans. Served in a small cup called a demitasse,
                and meant to be taken quickly, like a shot.</p>

            <p>Flat white is a coffee that is popular in Australia and New
                Zealand. It is made the same as a
                cappuccino expect it does not have any foam
                or chocolate on top.</p>
